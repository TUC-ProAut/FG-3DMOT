# FG-3DMOT: Optimization based 3D Multi-Object Tracking using Camera and Radar Data

We utilize an implicit data association which is solved jointly with the state estimation during optimization of the factor graph for robustness against inaccuracies of the object detector. By including as much information as possible into data association and state estimation we can further improve the robustness, reliability and accuracy of the tracking results.
